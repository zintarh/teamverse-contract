To help us address bugs quickly, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are using the latest version.
2. Confirm that your issue is not caused by incompatible environment components or versions.
3. Read the documentation to ensure the issue is not a misunderstanding.
4. Check if the issue has already been reported in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/zintarh/teamverse-contract/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).
5. Search the internet (e.g., Stack Overflow) for similar issues.

#### Collect Information About the Bug

- Stack trace or traceback logs.
- Operating System, Platform, and Version (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM).
- Version of interpreter, compiler, SDK, or runtime environment, as applicable.
- Steps to reproduce the issue consistently.
- Relevant input and expected/actual outputs.

#### How to Submit a Good Bug Report

**Note:** Never report security-related vulnerabilities publicly. Instead, email such reports directly to the developer.

1. Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/zintarh/teamverse-contract/issues/new).
2. Clearly explain the expected behavior and the actual behavior.
3. Include detailed reproduction steps and any relevant code snippets.
4. Provide all collected information (e.g., stack trace, platform details).

Once filed, the team will:

1. Label the issue appropriately.
2. Attempt to reproduce the issue using your provided steps. If steps are missing, the issue will be tagged `needs-repro`.
3. Upon reproduction, the issue will be tagged `needs-fix` (and possibly others) and made available

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

1. Ensure you are using the latest version.
2. Check the documentation to confirm the feature doesnâ€™t already exist.
3. Search [Issues](/issues) to see if a similar suggestion exists. If it does, comment on that issue instead of creating a new one.
4. Ensure your suggestion aligns with the project's scope and goals. Features that benefit the majority of users are prioritized.

#### How to Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion

1. Open a new [Issue](/issues/new).
2. Use a clear and descriptive title for your suggestion.
3. Provide a detailed step-by-step description of the enhancement.
